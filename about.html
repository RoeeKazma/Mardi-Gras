              The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe,
              passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to
              the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional
              revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her
              colonies. On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste
              Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground 60 miles
              directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras"
              when his men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday.
              Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is
              now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de
              la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras. In 1704,
              Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar
              to those that form our current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until
              1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
              from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's
              head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
              with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the coming
              Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.

              New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s,
              Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New Orleans, but not with the
              parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor,
              the Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which
              became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
              The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781
              report to the Spanish colonial governing body. That year, the
              Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
              hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New
              Orleans. By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of
              maskers with carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi
              Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for
              the krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance
              and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the
              Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to
              represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to
              New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and
              masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
